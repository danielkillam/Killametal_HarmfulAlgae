This folder contains toxin concentration data from various analyses done by Raphe Kudela's team at UCSC, Bill Cochlan's lab at SFSU, and other collaborators.

The identifying code at the end of each file name corresponds to the dataset IDs in "HAB_Data_Compilation." 

	tox1: Mussel_Toxins_20210913_tox1.gsheet" contains toxin concentrations from mussel tissues and the associated environmental metadata from the collection of mussels from marinas around San Francisco Bay.

		sheets:
			sheet1: "All_Results_2015-Present" contains the concentrations of microcystins (MCY), domoic acid (DA), and saxitoxins (STX) measured in mussel samples as well as environmental metadata from the sampling dates. Each row represents one sample (1 sample = total of 5 mussels collected) from one site. Four common microcystins (RR, YR, LR, and LA) were measured as well as total microcystins, total DA, and total SXT. A YSI EXO2 multiparameter sonde or YSI handheld were deployed in the water at the time of each sample collection and resulting temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll-a, fluorescent dissolved organic matter measurements included as separate columns.
			sheet2: "Site_Codes" contains the full site name and location that each site code from sheet1 represents.
			sheet3: "metadata_QAQC_notes" will contain relevant metadata and QAQC notes from UCSC within the next few months (9/10/21).
